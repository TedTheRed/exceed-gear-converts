## THIS REPO CONTAINS WIP CONVERTS!

## CONVERTS ARE NOT CONSIDERED COMPLETE UNTIL THEY ARE PUT IN A RELEASE!

The purpose of this repo is to manage the making of .ksh converts and open contributions publiclly. Complete charts will be released via the releases page simultaniously with the main folder on a per update basis. Despite the warning above, there is nothing stopping you from pulling this repo on your local machine for you to play them, but do be noted again that charts are not considered complete until they are part of a release. Dedicated reviewers are assigned to each chart to scan mistakes, so while reporting mistakes on a pending convert is not necessary, they are still appreciated. I would prefer if you only submitted  issues for charts that are already demmed complete or in the main folder

# How to Submit

There's different ways to submit your contributions

**Fork and Upload**
This is the prefered method for users looking to only contribute once, but may contribute more in the future

2. Go to your forked repo
3. Make the necessary changes to the convert
4. Upload any changed files to the correct folder
5. Submit a pull request on this page

**Fork, Clone and Push changes** This way requires [Git](https://git-scm.com/). This is the prefered method for regular contributors
